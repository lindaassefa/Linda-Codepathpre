App Description
    This application is developed in Xcode using the Swift programming language. The app allows the user to introduce themselves by accepting user inputs in various forms such as switches, text fields, segmented controls, etc. The information provided by the user will then be displayed in an alert box.
    The user will be able to increase the number of pets they own using a stepper, and when they tap the "Introduce Self" button, the app will generate an introduction using the information provided by the user. The introduction will be a string that includes information such as the user's name, school name, year of study, number of pets, and whether they want more pets. The app will print this introduction as a print statement.
